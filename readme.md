# org.thaliproject.iospackager

A simple plugin that uses Cordova build hooks to package, via [jx package] (http://jxcore.com/docs/jxcore-feature-packaging-code-protection.html#package), the node_modules directory of a typical Thali project. Doing this makes install very much quicker since instead of installing the thousands of files in a typical node_modules tree we install just a single .jx file instead.
